This app module makes it easier and quicker to read math symbols, expressions and equations written in the LaTeX document preparation system.  In addition to line-by-line Braille and speech translation, it also provides a matrix browser for using table-like navigation in order to move around matrices.  Using Python 2 is recommended."""
