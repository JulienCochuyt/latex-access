# Latex-Access Contributor Covenantal Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as
the Latex-Access contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of: age; body size; disability (physical or intellectual); psychological or psychiatric disorder; race / ethnicity; biological sex characteristics; gender; level of experience concerning the various processes and procedures of project development; education; socio-economic background or status; nationality; culture; personal appearance; religion; or sexuality.

## Our Standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
	* NOTE: Inclusive, by definition and implication, is intended to implicitly, as well as explicitly, cover the scope of one's rhetoric and attitude towards other peoples' viewpoints and experiences.  
* Gracefully offering and accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Giving credit where credit is due

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances, whether done publicly or privately
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or ideological attacks, whether done publicly or privately
	* NOTE: An attack, by definition and implication, means that behaviour will not be tolerated when directed towards an individual, if it is deemed to be genuinely abusive (verbally, emotionally, socially, threatened to be physically, or psychologically).
	* NOTE: Ideology, by definition, includes but is not limited to: politics, philosophy, epistemology, law, theology, etc.  It strongly anticipated that issues of this nature will be highly unlikely to occur in this environment.  If anything of this nature does occur then the project owner / moderators / collaborators will make evaluative assessments at their own executive discretion.  Mostly, if not categorically, such discussions will likely be considered by the community to be unhelpful, unproductive and out-of-bounds for this project.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, replies, references, links, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting the project owner, Nathaniel Schmidt, at schmidty2244@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
